**This is the first version of the application relevant to this [blog post](http://houssein.me/angular2-hacker-news).** There have been some structural and feature changes since then (Ahead of time compilation, Progressive Web Capabilites, more modularity).

The latest version of the app lives in the [master branch](https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/angular2-hn). Again, please don't hesitate to let me know if you see anything there that you don't understand :)
